                    <p class="proj-text">I am currently working on a research project that is assessing the extent to which a KNN machine learning model using Dr. William H. Wolberg’s Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset can be used in detecting malignant breast cancer tumors. I am researching the limitations and areas for improvement as well as experimenting to improve the accuracy of the model in detecting breast cancer.

                            <p class="proj-text">I noticed that our school district does not recycle unused school breakfast and school lunch. This led me to contact the Director of Food Services in order to request that the district start composting the unused food that is unable to be placed on the share table. At the moment, I am waiting for a response from the district. I plan to carry on advocacy and initiate a compost program in my school and district to take this waste and send it to our municipal composting facility, so it can be used to create fertile soil that can be used throughout the community.
